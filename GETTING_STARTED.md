# Getting Started — ternary-belief

> *Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes*

## Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.75+** (MSRV)
- Cargo (included with Rust)

## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ternary_belief = "0.1.0"
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuperInstance/ternary-belief.git
cd ternary-belief
cargo build --release
cargo test
```

## Core Concepts

This crate is part of the SuperInstance ternary ecosystem. It provides:

- Ternary {-1, 0, +1} semantics for belief
- Integration with the ternary type system via ternary-core traits
- Zero-Safe design: 0 is not nothing, it is a meaningful "neutral" state

## Quick Start

```rust
use {ternary_belief};
// VariableNode is the primary type
let instance = {VariableNode::new();
// ... use it
```

## Ternary Example

```rust
use ternary_belief::*;

// The (-1, 0, 1) values work with ternary-core arithmetic
let a = 1i8;  // Positive
let b = -1i8; // Negative
// Z₃ addition: 1 + (-1) = 0 (cancellation)

## Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```
